### Result:

Developing this application I utilized the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to implement a search for movie titles. Ultimately, MovieCollector app allows the movie fan to maintain an interactive list of movies he/she wants to watch. If a movie is selected, a modal shows a brief details of the movie including: movie poster, genre, cast, director(s), year of release and ratings. The Movie database API was also called to allo user to watch the movie trailer. 
Movie fan can label the movie as “watched” or remove it from the list.
